

Netflix is a popular streaming service that recommends TV shows to millions of users.  
Their recommendation system is a big reason why people stay on Netflix and keep watching.


# How Netflix’s Recommendation System Works

Netflix uses a mix of different methods to recommend shows:

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Suggests shows based on what similar users have liked.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Looks at the show’s genre, & actors
- **Behavioral Data**: Tracks what you watch, search for and how long you watch.


Netflix shows recommendations in sections like:
- "Because you watched..."
- "Top Picks for You"


# Scenario Design Analysis

Here’s the Scenario Design, answering three questions:

| **Who are the users?** | Millions of people who pay to watch Netflix.
| **What are the users trying to do?** | Keep people watching so they don’t cancel their subscription.
| **How does the site help them?** Shows them stuff that matches their tastes and helps them find new favorites. 

## Should We Do Scenario Design for Both? Yes!
Netflix’s goal (keep users engaged) and the user’s goal (find something good) are similar but not exactly the same.  


# Ideas to Improve Netflix’s Recommendations
Here are a few ways Netflix could get even better:

- **Mix in More Surprises**: Show some titles outside a user’s usual picks to help them discover new things.
- **Explain Why It’s Recommended**: Show messages like “Because you liked" more clearly.
- **Mood Filters**: Let people pick a mood like "funny," or "serious,"
- Better Feedback Options: Let users say what they want more or less of, not just thumbs up or thumbs down.
- Social Recommendations: Let people see (if they want) what’s popular with friends.
